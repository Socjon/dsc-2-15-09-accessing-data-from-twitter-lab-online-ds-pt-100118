    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this lab, we shall use our Twitter developer account created in the previous lessson and the keys we generated to make some API calls to twitter. We shall look at a number of ways of accessing twitter data which may suit different use cases for twitter API calling. We shall also get an introduction to the `tweepy` Python library to help us with tweet mining and parsing. We shall perform some basic NLP to count the term frequencies etc.\n",

One can build a custom list of stop-words, or use available lists (e.g. [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) provides a simple list for English stop-words). You can search Internet for domain specific stop-words as well as some words may carry a deeper meaning in one domain while could be meaningless in another. (Try thinking of a few examples).\n",
